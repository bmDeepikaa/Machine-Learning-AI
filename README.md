1. Develop a multilayer perceptron model, train it and test it on the dataset. You need to finetune the hyperparameters to select those that provide the best performance. 
2. Implement VGG16, which a CNN architecture, train it and test it on the dataset. You must NOT use the pre-implemented VGG16 network in Pytorch. Instead, you have to implement all the layers and blocks yourself from scratch. You need to finetune the hyperparameters to select those that provide the best performance. 
3. Repeat step 2 above , but this time using the pretrained VGG16 network of PyTorch. 
4. For each of the tasks above, you need to finetune the hyper parameters to achieve the best performance possible.
5. Compare the performance of the three models.
