1. the datasets are in public repo in github and if need to access 
    - Test Dataset path : [te3st/Test_food_classification_dataset](https://github.com/bmDeepikaa/te3st/tree/main/Test_food_classification_dataset)
    - Train/Valid dataset : https://github.com/bmDeepikaa/te3st/tree/main/Food%20Classification%20dataset

2. The google colab would terminate sessions after 11-12 hrs thus none of my epoch could be good enough to train the model well enough to have better accuracy in prediction.

3. have attached the model image under other performances section that shows that the 3rd model might be the best if not for the timeout issue
